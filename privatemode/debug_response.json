The importance of the context was analysed (see for \r\nexample Bate (20)) as well as the literature on diffusion of innovation (Greenhalgh (21)) and the \r\nconcept of assimilation, which goes beyond implementation and adoption. The recent analysis \r\nof feasibility of patient engagement methods by Grande (22) was included.
